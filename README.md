# InfoSearch
This script was created to help manage the database for AcquiWatch.

It takes a company name from a field in a CSV file, adds " acquisition" and google searches.
It then returns the top 4 results on google and provides a title and description for each.
The user can then choose one of the 4 descriptions to be saved and output to a new CSV file.

Please note:
This script is provided simply as a proof of concept, there will be no further updates or support.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
